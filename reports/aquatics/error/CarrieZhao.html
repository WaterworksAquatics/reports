							<tr><td><b><dd> I walked into the facility in the morning and met up with co-worker Drew. I asked if we tested the water and she reported to me that the chlorine levels were high while showing me a picture of her results.  On my next break, I immediately went to the front desk to report the situation as seen.  I stated that the chlorine levels are too high and could be leading to the rashes that Drew and I have been getting.  The front desk lady stated that rashes have happened before at her previous LA fitness and these rashes could be contagious. She also stated that I should go to the doctor to get it checked out since someone at her last LA fitness actually caught a skin virus from the pool. She will contact Stephanie, the Operations Manager. I went back to the pool and continued on with my lessons. Throughout my lessons, students would complain that the water is too cold and I would agree that the water was colder than normal. Eventually it got too out of hand to where students would refuse lessons and parents would be angry that they're still paying for lessons.  I was not in control of the temperature of the pool so I told parents to talk to LA fitness since it is their facility and that is exactly what they did. Malek and Mariam Chalfouh's mom was extremely frustrated since Malek would not get in the pool at all.  She went to the front desk complained  and told me that they told her that I did not report anything in the morning. An employee named Osiris  walked into the pool deck saying that my report did not match the mom's complaint. I was trying to tell him that it was a miscommunication but he insisted that if I talked over him or gave him attitude he won't help me. So I told him to explain and after he explained that what was written on the paper did not match the story, I spoke and explained my side. I stated that I was sorry that the complaint wasn't matching but I don't want anything happening to the kids. So he repeated himself stating that it wasn't the same report and parent complaint. I then told him that it is not my facility and I cannot do anything if something is not right, but he said I was giving him attitude and rolled my eyes so he wasn't going to help us and walked away. Parents of Malek and Mariam, Isabella and Lucas, Isabella C, and Sasha witnessed the entire situation and asked me to explain. So I stated that I have went to the front desk for the past two weeks stating that chlorine levels have been high and Drew and I both have been getting rashes. Sarah's mom ultimately decided not to continue with lessons and walked out. Drew and I continued with lessons until the pool was shut down for retesting and readjusting. I feel as if the LA Fitness did not take me seriously since I am a "kid", "inexperienced", or "too young to understand."</dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2. Overall, how did your lessons that were on the level advancement report go today?<br></td></tr>

							<tr><td><b><dd>I tried my best to remain calm and productive while undergoing a stressful situation. </dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>6. Did you learn anything new about a family today (FORD)?<br></td></tr>
							<tr><td><b><dd>Yes, families are more than happy to listen to our tips and tricks! Emerson and Genevieve were extremely tired and I told their parents that enrollment in more sports while swimming would increase their stamina and endurance and they completely agreed! </dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>7. Do you have any additional questions and/or concerns you would like to share?<br></td></tr>
							<tr><td><b><dd>Why did it take a parent to complain before things got done? Why don't they listen to us?</dd></b><br /></td></tr>			</table>
