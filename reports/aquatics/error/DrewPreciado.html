							<tr><td><b><dd>I came in This morning and tested the water how I normally do and when I noticed the levels were high I took a picture and then told my coworker Carrie she then went to the front desk on her break, while I had a lesson, and told them that the levels were high. We continued with our lessons even with the kids shivering and complaining about how cold the water was. Though we couldn’t do anything about that, all we could to was continue and push through. One of the LA fitness employees, who I later found names is Osiris, came to the pool deck area and started being extremely rude to Carrie and some of the parents really seemed to take that seriously and pulled their kid out of lessons for that day then another went directly to the front desk and started complaining. They asked Carrie what was happening and she explained to them. She stated that the chlorine levels were high and that both she and I were getting rashes. She pointed to me for reassurance asking if she has been reporting it for a few weeks to which I said yes. Sasha’s mom took her and walked out due to the unsanitary conditions. We tried to continue lessons afterwards until the pool got shut down. We immediately tried to contact a manager to explain.</dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2.

							<tr><td><b><dd>I feel that I haven’t been taken seriously because of the fact that I am a minor. For example I’ve let the LA fitness people know for the past few weeks now on and off again how high the chlorine levels are however it wasn’t until a parent complained that something was done. </dd></b><br /></td></tr>			</table>
