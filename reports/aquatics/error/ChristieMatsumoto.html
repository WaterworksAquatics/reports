							<tr><td><b><dd>Kit Godsey did not complete her second 20 minute lesson today because of a confusion of lesson start time with the parents of a later student (Fatima). What ended up happening is that I ended Kit’s lesson 10 mins early and asked her dad to schedule a make-up, then I took Fatima and Julian for a shared SP lesson (full 20 mins). After I checked the tablet afterwards (was unable to open app during lesson) I realized I should have kept Kit and added Julian, then had Fatima later. It was very hectic for me I’m the moment. Please send my apologies to Kit’s dad, who was likely upset but understanding at the time.</dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2.

							<tr><td><b><dd>Yes, to nearly all my students. Esp new student Ester.</dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>5. What were you proud of that you were able to accomplish today?<br></td></tr>

							<tr><td><b><dd>I would like the office to apologize to Kit’s dad on my behalf and I would ask that the parents know their child’s start time. It would have cleared the confusion up—Fatima’s mom told me the wrong start time and I got confused. </dd></b><br /></td></tr>			</table>
