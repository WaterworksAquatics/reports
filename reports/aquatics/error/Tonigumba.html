							<tr><td><b><dd>My last 2 SP were b2b. Siblings 3 years of age apart, the oldest a level 4, the youngest was her very first lesson. I began talking to their dad 10 minutes before their lesson explaining that because of their difference in levels teaching both of them at the same time would be the least efficient way for them to learn and suggested instead,teaching them 20 minutes each. Dad wanted them both in the water for 40 minutes straight, he asked me to try and if it wasnt working he would be ok with 1 at a time. We tried and 10 minutes into the lesson he agreed that one at a time would be best for them to both learn. He scheduled our following lessons for 2 private b2b with me for his youngest sydney since she started to build a relationship with me and 2 private b2b lessons for madison  with MJ</dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>7.

							<tr><td><b><dd>Tran (4yo) really improved on slowing down her rollovers so that she doesnt get water on her face and start to "sit up" along with actually getting her hands out of the water for free. She doesnt seem comfortable doing a rollover on het own while swimming but could do it back and forth floating in the water.
TRAN 6YO is still very uncomfortable in the water, can stand in 3'6 but requests to be held, or at the wall. Requests her sister always goes first and tries to distract from her self and not participate. She is scared of not being held up and still tries to hold on to anything around her when. She can not go into a rollover unassisted. Spoke with her dad about the importance of coming consistently and possible another class a week. They have an upcoming vacation and will have a lapse, i suggested make ups to do 20 m b2b, they really started to nake progress towards the end. Nect class i thinkni will talk to him about private so she doesnt have any other distractions to take herself away from it.</dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>8.
