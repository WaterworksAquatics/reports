							<tr><td><b><dd>The levels given to the children that I worked with did not seem to correspond to their actual skill levels. Vara and Nikhil were first time students set to level 5 but have a strong understanding of each stroke. I moved them to 9 since their butterfly needs a little more work. 

Andrew Lam was set to a level 10 but he couldn't really do breast stroke. He struggled greatly with his kicks and couldn't make it further than a quarter of the pool before tiring. Unsure how to handle this situation</dd></b><br /></td></tr>			</table>
