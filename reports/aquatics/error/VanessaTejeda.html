							<tr><td><b><dd>They went well, I had a student that has had several lessons and different instructors but has showed no progression with her backfloats. I sent a shadow request for the next lesson and am hoping I can apply the feedback I get from the shadow lesson and hopefully get my student to feel more confident with her backfloats.</dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>3.

							<tr><td><b><dd>I’m proud of myself for helping a student break a bad habit that was created while being with another instructor.

							<tr><td><b><dd>Instructor Myra opened the goggles that we have for sell and are letting students use them if they don’t have any, or have forgotten theirs.
