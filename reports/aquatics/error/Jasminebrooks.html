							<tr><td><b><dd>The pool is clean, and really nicely set up. Although I was told to do daily reports by my trainer carissa, I don't see my location anywhere on any of the tabs. In fact I haven't seen any locations in an l.a fitness. I am at the Poway facility, but selected Carlsbad because Its the only facility I know. I'm sorry if I'm not supposed to fill out daily reports at a non-waterworks facility. I also noticed for my requesting to do a different activity when I have no students, it does not let me select a manager, it only says "please choose" . When leaving it on the please choose tab it doesn't allow me to select a manager even if I have "l.a. fitness poway" selected. Im sorry thats alot</dd></b><br /></td></tr>			</table>
