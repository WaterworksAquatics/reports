							<tr><td><b><dd>Dad called in after mom on 10/03. Dad spoke with me saying his wife had an unpleasant call today when she called in wanting to cancel the lessons for 10/03. Mom was giving a courtesy call to cancel lesson and to let instructor know they won't make it for class. Didn't want instructor waiting in the pool. However, mom did not like how the call went and said she had always had a great experience with us and was shocked after her call today with CEE. Family did not ask for a manager but just wanted to voice their concern about today's experience.</dd></b><br /></td></tr>			</table>
