He also received another job offer in retail, I told him I could look into getting him a higher bonus amount but ultimately the issue is his skin and health, not the money. He said he loves this job he's just worried about his skin. He also has a history of eczema on his arms, but hasn't had an issues with arms, it's on his neck and face. </dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>5. When is there last day?<br></td><td><b></b></td></tr>
