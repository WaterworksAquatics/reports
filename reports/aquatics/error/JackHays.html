							<tr><td><b><dd>(INCASE THE REPORT OVER THE PHONE DIDN'T SEND) Hunter Lenh, a student who I've had 8:20am-8:40am on previous Sundays, didn't show up on today's schedule. I showed up for my 8:40 class, and encountered Hunter's father, who told me they'd been waiting on my 8:20 appointment. I asked if he'd run out of paid classes, he said he had 4 left. I told him to contact the office and took Hunter into my 8:40 semi private. I then contacted Michelle and told her about the situation, she told me to submit a daily report and that she'd look into it. Hours later, Hunter finally appeared on my schedule, but it says he has 0 paid classes left, meaning he's likely to disappear again next weekend.</dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2.
