							<tr><td><b><dd>For the last few weeks, I have had a number of parents complain that the office has not been very helpful in finding or helping parents get classes on my schedule. One of my student's parents was promised by the office that they would switch out the adult class for her daughter and when she went to look at the schedule they told her that they could not find an open slot with me and that she needed to look back at the schedule. 

I also had a parent interrupt my second to last lesson today. We happened to open our mouths at the same time when I told him that I was running 5 minutes late he tried to tell me that his daughter (who was in my next class) was sitting with grandma. He said that I was being rude to him and that I should let him finish talking when I was simply trying to tell him that I was running late with my class. </dd></b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>2.
